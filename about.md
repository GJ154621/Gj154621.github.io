# About Me
Hello! I am G. J
An interest I have is to get better at computer science and try to understand more about the computer sicence world. I also am very creative when it comes to making stuff, im aso very organized and willing to listen and learn when it comes to new things, I could also use the information I learned in computer science towards the future. I also wanna find a suitable job that will provide me with at least a decent lifestyle, a job that I have interest in so I wont be miserable.
